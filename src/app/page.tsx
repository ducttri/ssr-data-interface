            The <b>IM</b>pulsive <b>P</b>hase <b>R</b>apid <b>E</b>nergetic
            <b> S</b>olar <b>S</b>pectrometer (IMPRESS) is a solar science
            mission that will fly a hard X-ray ({">"}
            10 keV) spectrometer on a 3U CubeSat to investigate particle
            acceleration in solar flares. IMPRESS will perform soft and hard
            X-ray (SXR and HXR, respectively) spectroscopy of solar flares in
            the rising phase of Solar Cycle 25. IMPRESS is optimized to observe
            high-cadence HXR and SXR spectra from a wide range of solar flares
            (targeting C1 to X1 class flares) without saturating the detector
            and without the need for disruptive movable attenuators. These
            measurements will be used to (1) investigate sub-second variations
            in HXR flux that strongly constrain flare acceleration timescales;
            (2) perform a mission of opportunity by co-observing HXRs from solar
            flares along with the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays
            (STIX) onboard Solar Orbiter, systematically studying directivity;
            and serve as a HXR monitor of flares associated with solar eruptive
            events that will drive space weather in the next solar cycle.

            The IMPRESS detectors are four CeBr scintillator crystals read out
            by silicon photomultipliers and one Amptek X123 silicon drift diode.
            To capture fast time variations, these detectors will produce 4-12
            keV SXR spectra at a 1 Hz cadence and 8-100 keV HXR spectra at a 32
            Hz cadence. The payload is carried on a 3U CubeSat platform. IMPRESS
            has a target launch date of late 2024 with a planned minimum mission
            life of at least 6 months.

            The data acquired by will be used to help understand how solar
            flares accelerate particles to extraordinarily high energies. Fast
            bursts undistinguishable to previous solar-dedicated HXR imagers
            (e.g. RHESSI) will be analyzed to understand their durations and
            distributions, placing key constraints on particle acceleration
            processes. Coordinated observations with STIX will systematically
            studying HXR directivity, providing a quantitative test of the
            thick-target model of solar flares. This topic is of importance to
            NASA in that it deepens our understanding of the Sun, Earth, Solar
            System, and Universe (Strategic Objective 1.1) and also addresses
            national challenges and catalyzes economic growth via developing and
            transferring revolutionary technologies to enable exploration
            capabilities for NASA and the nation (Strategic Objective 3.1).
            IMPRESS&apos;s detector system is being developed with the intention
            of its applicability to any system requiring fast high-energy (X-ray
            and gamma ray) spectroscopy with high time precision.
